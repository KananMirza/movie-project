The only hope for survival is for soldiers and civilians from the present to be transported to the future and join the fight. Among those recruited is high school teacher and family man Dan Forester (Chris Pratt). Determined to save the world for his young daughter, Dan teams up with a brilliant scientist (Yvonne Strahovski) and his estranged father (J.K. Simmons) in a desperate quest to rewrite the fate of the planet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"poster__rating\">\r\n\r\n        <i class=\"poster__star fas fa-star\"></i>\r\n        <p class=\"poster__value\">6.7</p>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</section>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"80f06191066bfbd664b23a2e5b19cbcd","cacheData":{}}
